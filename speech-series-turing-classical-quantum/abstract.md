# Abstract

This speech series aims to teach the implementation of single-cycle CPU architecture using MIPS assembly. The prerequisite of this speech is having a basic knowledge of the Turing machine. The lesson will cover CMOS transistors to MIPS CPU. The first half of the address would introduce CMOS transistors and uses transistors to build logic gates. After that, it teaches how to construct combinational circuits and sequential circuits using logic gates. This concludes all the tools needed for a CPU. The second half of the speech focuses on assembly language and MIPS CPU. It points out that assembly language is a finite state machine, and the registers are the Turing machine tape. Finally, it would go over how a CPU works under MIPS single-cycle architecture. In summary, this speech covers the smallest computing unit, CMOS, all the way to CPU design, and it is a prerequisite to the next topic on quantum computers.
